<h3>Ijevan’s Sculpture Symposiums</h3>
<p>The symposiums organized in Ijevan were different from other symposiums that were organized in Armenia because they were organized regularly from 1985 until 1991. During these symposiums, 113 sculptures were created in total and each of the works had a different style and a theme. The statues are mainly located in the Ijevan Sculpture Park and the Children’s Park while some of them can be found at the entrance of the city. In addition, a few are located in a village named Getahovit, which is a nearby community only a few kilometers away from Ijevan. Seventy-eight young and experienced sculptors came from different parts of the world to create these pieces of art in Ijevan.</P>      
<P>The first All-Union symposium was organized in 1985 under the slogan “Peace and work” during which time 13 statues were created. The Second All-Union Symposium was held in 1986, a year that the UN declared “A Year of Peace” and for which the symposium was dedicated. The last two symposiums at the Ijevan sculpture park were organized in 1990-1991 where sculptors worked during wartime and created art that spoke against injustice.</P>
<p>Most of the sculptures’ themes were also related to Spitak’s earthquake, Sumgait’s genocide, and Karabakh's war. The sculptors usually used allegorical, reproductive, heroic, biblical, and epic-patriotic themes. The main stones used by sculptors were Armenian stones, such as tuff, local marble and sandstone. It is also believed that the color and the texture of the stones usually told the author what character should be created. The sculptors turned Ijevan into an open air museum under the sky. Ijevan symposiums were also unusual events in Armenian’s cultural life. During these 7 years, Armenia became enriched by 113 new sculptures that were created by 78 Armenian and foreign sculptors.</p>
<p>Overall, symposiums organized in Ijevan played a big role in the development of Armenian modern art too, leading to the organization of similar symposiums in other cities such as Yerevan, Alaverdi, Jermuk, Khojalu, Stepanakert, and more. Sculptures created at these symposiums displayed themes about Armenian modern history, ethnography, and mythology. The dominating styles are arcadian, animalistic, classic, realistic, romantic, cubist, Dadaistic, surrealistic, organic, geometric, and ornamental styles. Sometimes you can see the mixture of these styles which makes the sculptures more artistic.</p>
